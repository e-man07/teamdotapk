                In 2024, three passionate developers from the same city found themselves in the same
                Discord server, discussing the latest developments in blockchain technology. What started as casual
                conversations about smart contracts and DeFi protocols quickly evolved into late-night coding sessions
                and collaborative projects.
              </p>

              <p>
                We discovered that our skills complemented each other perfectly â€” one specialized in smart contract
                development, another in full-stack applications, and the third in AI and security. Together, we formed
                an unstoppable team that could tackle any blockchain challenge thrown our way.
              </p>

              <p>
                Since that first collaboration, we've never looked back. We've built across multiple chains, won
                numerous hackathons, secured grants, and most importantly, formed a friendship that goes beyond just
                business partnerships.
